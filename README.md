# Welcome to the Livingston Community Center Continuing Education Center

This site, created by Michelle Harrop for HartCode Academy 2019, helps adult students find courses hosted at and by the local community center.

# Site Pages
- The index page gives information about the Continuing Education Center. 
- The courses page lets a user select a category or browse all the available courses. Soon, it will also have the option to add a course. 
- The details page gives details about a specific course. From here, the user can register for a course or edit a course. Soon, this will have an option to remove a student as well.
- The register page is where the user can add their name and email to the course.
- The add a course page will allow the user to add a course to the list (this will include text inputs and dropdowns).
- The edit course page will allow the user to edit the course (when it meets, how much it costs, the location, the start and end dates) and save those changes.

# Now Featuring

The site now features a fieldset, as seen in Cori and Vanessa's projects, as well as validation, which it did not have before.


# Access
After loading the project to your computer, you will need to open the command prompt. You will need to navigate to the folder for this particular project, then type "node server.js". The command prompt should return "App listening at port 8081". From here, you will need to go to http://localhost:8081/index.html to view the project.
